To get it started, start Matlab and change the folder to the directory where you unzipped the program, and then type the main program name "Smart_Residential_Load_Simulator" on the Matlab console. This will start the Graphical User Interface (GUI), which includes some help and demos. 

To learn how the program works, two demos are provided with the simulator. To review them and run them, click on the Case 1 and/or Case 2 tabs, which describe the examples. Clicking the Continue tab will load the demo data, which can then be run in the main simulator window by pressing on the Run tab. It'll take a few seconds, depending on your machine, to run the simulation, after which you can press the Plot tab which will trigger a new window with a variety of plots where you can select the variables you wish to graph.
